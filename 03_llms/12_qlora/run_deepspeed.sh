#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
# One GPU is enough to compare per-GPU memory; more ranks each need 24 GB.

#SBATCH --partition=h200-low
# Update to match your cluster's partitions (check with: sinfo)

#SBATCH --time=02:00:00
# Wall-clock ceiling. The job is killed at this point, so overestimate.

#SBATCH --job-name=qlora

#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
# ONE task. The `deepspeed` launcher spawns one worker per GPU itself; letting
# SLURM also start one task per GPU gives N^2 processes and usually a hang.

#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
# Cores for the data pipeline. Too few starves the dataloader and the GPU
# idles between batches — which looks like a slow model and is not.

#SBATCH --mem=48G
